# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

## Overview: 

- As I'm sure you're well aware of what the A* pathfinding algorithm is, I won't go into too much detail.
Basically, A* is a variant of Dijkstra's algo, and uses inherent movements costs to decide its 
node traversal. These costs (g, h, and f) are the distance from the current node to the start node, 
the distance from the current node to the end node (calculated from a heuristic), and the sum of the
the g and h costs above.

- I implement this algorithm using python and create a graphical user interface and visualization using
tools imported from tkinter.

## Roadblocks!

- Frankly, there weren't any real roadblocks or obstacles. After learning the theory of the algorithm, 
I planned it out with pencil and paper, then proceeded to implement it in an orderly fashion.

## Solutions

- Again no roadblocks this time around. Calm n collected approaches always result in solid implementation.
